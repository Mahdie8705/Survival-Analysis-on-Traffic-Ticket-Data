Factors are assigned to the categorical variables.
Different survival models including Cox Regression, Accelerated Failure Times with Exponential, Weibull, Log-normal, and Log-logistics are generated. Kaplan-Meier curves are also plotted.
The generated models are compared based on AIC measurement, the one with lower AIC will be the best model.
